This app will `generate and solve` small mazes using some of the most famous algorithms known in the domain.
It's coded in Java and features a CLI or GUI interface (done with JavaFX). To make this app I used mainly 2 design patterns: `Strategy` and  `MVC`. The strategy
pattern was needed to be able to add, modify, or remove any generation/solving algorithm whitout modifying any code outside the file needed to implement the
new algorithm. Instead, the MVC pattern was used to manage and coordinate the dat, logic, and representation layer of the application.

## Prerequisites
```
- Java 11+
- JavaFX 14.0.1
- Maven 4.0.0
- Junit 5.3.1
```
## How to build and run

### Build
To generate the jar file for the application simply run `mvn package`, and you should see the `MazeVisualizer.jar` app in the main folder. For convenience,
I've already included the complete .jar ion the repository.

### Run
To run the app, you can simply double click on it if you have a JRE 11+, or you cna run into the terminal the command <br />
`java -jar MazeVisualizer.jar`.

### Iterative Backtracking
This is one of the easiest maze generation algorithms. It's also know as `Randomized Depth-first Search`, and I implemented it using a stack. The idea is pretty simple: having a cursor that explores randomly the board choosing always one of the 4 possible directions (UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT). When a movement from a cell to another is completed, then the wall between these cells is eliminated. If starting from a position all the 4 adiacent cells are already been seen, then the the algorithm backtrack to the last previously seen cell. This process goes on until the board is completely explored.

### Randomized Prim
The idea of this algorithm is that creating a frontier composed of wall, and gradually expanding it till every cell has been visited, will result is a maze. The pseudocode is the following:
```
1) Start with a grid full of walls.
2) Pick a cell, mark it as part of the maze. Add the walls of the cell to the wall list.
3) While there are walls in the list:
  3.1) Pick a random wall from the list. If only one of the cells that the wall divides is visited, then:
    3.1.1) Make the wall a passage and mark the unvisited cell as part of the maze.
    3.1.2) Add the neighboring walls of the cell to the wall list.
  3.2) Remove the wall from the list.
```

### Recursive Division
The algorithm works by recusively dividing the maze space in sub-mazes. The algorithm start with a maze with no wall, then it places 2 wall that cover the entire maze length: 1 horizontal and 1 vertical. Then, having divided the original maze in 4 submazes, 3 wall segments are chosen randomly, and in these 3 segment a single wall is eliminated. Then the entire process is repeated for all the created sub-mazes.

### Multiple Path
All the algorithm seen till now create mazes that only have 1 right path that leads to the exit. This algorithm instead creates a maze that has 3 possible paths that solve the maze. To do that we run 2 consecutive instances of the `Randomized Prim's algorithm` having the first instance starting from the start cell, while the second instance start from the end cell. Each instance will grow its wall boundaries untill remains a cell that has not been visited and can be directly reached by that instance. At the end of the algorithm we will have 2 sub-mazes that span the entire board, and are connected by a single frontier. At that point we ranmly choose 3 wall on that frontier and we eliminate them. In this way we will have created a maze with 3 possible solving paths.

### Eller's sets
This algorithm is able to generate a maze considering only one row of the board each step, and finished in linear time. It does this by building the maze one row at a time, using sets to keep track of which columns are ultimately connected. Here's an overview of the algorithm:
```
1) Initialize the cells of the first row to each exist in their own set.
2) Now, randomly join adjacent cells, but only if they are not in the same set. When joining adjacent cells, merge the cells
   of both sets into a single set, indicating that all cells in both sets are now connected (there is a path that connects
   any two cells in the set).
3) For each set, randomly create vertical connections downward to the next row. Each remaining set must have at least one vertical
   connection. The cells in the next row thus connected must share the set of the cell above them.
4) Flesh out the next row by putting any remaining cells into their own sets.
5) Repeat until the last row is reached.
6) For the last row, join all adjacent cells that do not share a set, and omit the vertical connections, and youâ€™re done!
```
The process can be visualized using these first steps of the algorithm:
